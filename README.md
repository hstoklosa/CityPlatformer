# ðŸ‘¾ CityPlatformer | 2D Game

## Concept

The game is a 2D platformer developed in Java, utilising a physics engine to stimulate the game world. It presents a dynamic and engaging experience, mixing typical platforming elements with a focus on creativity.

The main idea of the game is that the player should navigate through various levels, each presenting unique environments with its own challenges, by using portals that are found on the pre-defined locations.

The environments consists of entities such as

-   various types of <a href="enemies">enemies</a> that could be static/dynamic
-   <a href="collectibles">collectibles</a> to be picked up by the player
-   interactive and non-interactive <a href="blocks">blocks</a>

Your objective is to collect as many coins as possible by playing this character <img src="https://github.com/hstoklosa/hstoklosa/blob/main/assets/city-platformer/character.png?raw=true" width="20" style="vertical-align: center;"/>, using the following <a href="controls">controls</a> in game. The character is equipped with a name, health and stamina, and it can be recharged throughout the game.

In order to make the game more modern and visually pleasing, I have decided to implement a system (i.e., with [SpriteLoader](https://github.com/hstoklosa/CityPlatformer/blob/main/src/game/utils/SpriteLoader.java) and [AnimationHandler](https://github.com/hstoklosa/CityPlatformer/blob/main/src/game/handler/animation/AnimationHandler.java)) which applies appropriate animations to the bodies defined in the physics library using spritesheets.

Animation Examples:

-   Idle character
-   Moving character (including walk and run)
-   Jump (and double jump)
-   Spinning coin
-   Portal enchantment

## Controls

The game's controls are hard-coded, however you can use `ESC` button to pause the game and access some of the available options.

<a name="enemies"></a>

## Enemies

The enemies inserted onto each level are the biggest threat to the player since their main objective is to prevent the player from progressing onto further levels by dealing damage.

As the enemy is destroyed, a <a href="collectibles">coin</a> is spawned and it can be collected by the player to increase game score.

## Collectibles

### Collectible Spawning

-   Collectibles are placed at pre-defined coordatinates - randomising this process can be a future objective.
-   Collectibles have a chance to spawn when an enemy is destroyed. The choice of item is random, but the chance of an item spawning is the same for all collectibles.

## Saving & High score

### Saving

In order to save the current state of the game, the player must use the `S` control/keybind to overwrite the `CityPlatformer/saves.txt` file.

This data can be later loaded in the game using either the main menu button or the `L` control. This will appropriately read the file using streams and load the data into the respective world.

### High score

<img src="https://github.com/hstoklosa/hstoklosa/blob/main/assets/city-platformer/highscores.png?raw=true" alt="Highscore Game Screen" style="width: 100%;" />

As soon as the player finishes the last level, the game will look into the `CityPlatformer/scores.txt` file to find the appropriate position for the final score and name of the player.

This data can be later accessed using the high score screen within the game.

## Planned features

-   [ ] Use MySQL to store scores and saves (partially done)
